+ Exit gracefully when exception thrown (e.g. infinite switch mode loop)
+ IndicatorManager should listen for mouse position and give it to WindowsIndicator
+ Update hint windows when screens changed?
+ Hint undo key could be a combo instead of a key
+ Rename Mouse, Wheel, etc. to Mouse/Wheel/...Configuration
+ mode.blinking-mouse.enabled/visible-duration/invisible-duration
++ Zoom mode? Useful for 2-stage hint?
+ Configuration for indicator offset
+ Improve error handling in config parser
 + Wrap all parseBoolean/... into try catch that log the error with the property key and value

+ Check if the preparation is still a prefix of at least one combo.
 + If it is not, then it means a key is being pressed for longer than what the combo expects,
 + and the key can be regurgitated (just like it is regurgitated upon key release).
 + (Regurgitate only +key, not #key.)
- Regurgitate every x ms a key press until is release by user/remapper or another key is pressed.
 - Not just regurgitate, but sendinputs from remapping too
 + Mimics Windows repeat delay and repeat rate. No because apparently they are hardware-dependent.
+ Hint box border is broken for position history hints
+ It is possible to re-implement a zoom without using the Windows Magnifier:
 + https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63111438/implement-lens-magnification-to-magnify-the-windows-taskbar
   (it requires UIAccess)

+ move-to-last-selected-hint command?
- _{leftctrl} should be allowed release: _{leftctrl} +a -leftctrl +b
 - _{leftctrl} should only mean that leftctrl has to be pressed beforehand
 - Similarly ^{leftctrl}: ^{leftctrl} +a +leftctrl +b

- Hint box border: share (split 50/50) border only if there is another hint box next to it

+ Zoom
 + zoom-in=+leftshift, zoom-out commands
  + zoom.center=screen-center, mouse, last-selected-hint
  + zoom.increment-percent=4.0
 (+ zoom.max-percent, min-percent? min >= 1)
  - No zoom commands. Instead: hint2-2-mode.zoom.percent=5.0, .center=...
 - Always full screen
 - Show hints on top of zoomed window, with scaled coordinates and size
  + Also scale grid and indicator
 + smooth-zoom-enabled=true, smooth-zoom-velocity (like smooth-jump)
  + Expensive if hints need to be recomputed
   + Hide hints while animating and compute hints only once with the final zoom percent?
 + ZoomSynchronization mouse-and-zoom-center-unsynchronized, zoom-center-follows-mouse
  + Or: always follow mouse but only if it moves (otherwise stay on last-selected-hint)
   + No because doesn't work with smooth jump
   + Actually maybe because MagSetWindowSource is expensive and if we can not call it when
     moving the mouse, that is better.
- Font size, etc. should be decimals (because scaled by zoom): border width of 0.2: 0.2 * zoom(5.0) = 1px

- font-outline-thickness, outline-color, outline-blur=true, (offset x/y?)
+ Space each hint key, font-box-width-percent=1.0 means spaced evenly across the whole cell
++ logging.redact-keys=true
- Empty position history problem: add current position if empty
++ hint.box-border-length=1 means one dot (of size box.thickness) as the border?
