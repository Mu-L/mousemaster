_shift,^shift = press shift, release shift?
+ begin when key down, end when key up?
 + <mode>.<action> = <key combo>
 + default-mode.to.mouse-mode=_ctrl,^ctrl,_ctrl,^ctrl

+ temp-mouse-mode.timeout.duration=1s # automatically changes mode if no key combo was detected during 1s and no action is currently running (e.g. move-up)
+ temp-mouse-mode.timeout.next-mode=default-mode
+ temp-mouse-mode.oneshot.next-mode=default-mode # once an action has run (e.g. move-up), mode changes automatically
+ Can assign multiple combo to same action
 + mouse-mode.press-left=_lshift
 + mouse-mode.press-left=_rshift
+ Can assign one combo to multiple actions

 + default-mode.start-move-left=_leftarrow,^leftarrow,_leftarrow
+ any key involved in a combo should be eaten (e.g. / + Up, / should not write / in IDE)
 + In _ctrl,_/ the / should be eaten only if ctrl was pressed (i.e. combo is being prepared)
 + Ctrl+A,B == _ctrl _a ^ctrl ^a _b and _ctrl _a ^a ^ctrl _b
 + Could do complex combo like hold ctrl, then a, then a again: _ctrl _a ^a _a ^a
 + combo timeout = time after which we stop waiting for a combo to be completed (150ms,?)
 + A combo has to be non-interrupted (no unknown key presses), with at most 150ms between keys
  + Large timeout to allow Ctrl, wait, Z. Or special __ctrl to indicate no timeout. Or no timeout at all?
+ Should a keyevent unrelated to a combo break the combo preparation? Yes.
 + Don't want to scroll accidentally while moving mouse quickly and hitting arrow,...,arrow
 + Should a reached combo reset the preparation (no combo accumulation)? No
  -- Imagine Ctrl+up/down moves the mouse. We want to be able to hold Ctrl, (wait long) then up/down
   + This should be done with a mode (enabled with Ctrl)
  + _arrow,^arrow,_arrow should enable mouse mode and move up
  + _arrow,^arrow,_arrow,^arrow,(some time)_arrow should enable mouse mode then move up
  + _arrow,^arrow,_arrow,^arrow,_arrow should enable mouse mode then scroll up
+ Combo(List<KeyAction>), KeyAction(Key, KeyState=PRESSED,RELEASED)
 + KeyEvent(time, action)
 + Preparation(List<KeyEvent> events)
  + Reset when last key event is not a prefix of any combo
 + Preparation.isPrefixOf(Combo)
+ teleport key should use current display size percentage
+ Speed should not change when overlapping press-left/press-right. Speed set to 0 when all released.
 + On overlaps (press-left/press-right), last action wins (need a stack push/pop)
+ vimium-like hint (warpd), keynav-like grid?
+ position history
+ Move mouse to center of focused app?
