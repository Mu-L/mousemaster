+ Exit gracefully when exception thrown (e.g. infinite switch mode loop)
+ IndicatorManager should listen for mouse position and give it to WindowsIndicator
+ Update hint windows when screens changed?
+ Hint undo key could be a combo instead of a key
+ Rename Mouse, Wheel, etc. to Mouse/Wheel/...Configuration
+ mode.blinking-mouse.enabled/visible-duration/invisible-duration
++ Zoom mode? Useful for 2-stage hint?
+ Configuration for indicator offset
+ Improve error handling in config parser
 + Wrap all parseBoolean/... into try catch that log the error with the property key and value

+ Check if the preparation is still a prefix of at least one combo.
 + If it is not, then it means a key is being pressed for longer than what the combo expects,
 + and the key can be regurgitated (just like it is regurgitated upon key release).
 + (Regurgitate only +key, not #key.)
- Regurgitate every x ms a key press until is release by user/remapper or another key is pressed.
 - Not just regurgitate, but sendinputs from remapping too
 + Mimics Windows repeat delay and repeat rate. No because apparently they are hardware-dependent.
+ Hint box border is broken for position history hints
+ It is possible to re-implement a zoom without using the Windows Magnifier:
